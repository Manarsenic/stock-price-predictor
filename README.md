### Project Overview

This project is an advanced, interactive Google Colab notebook designed to provide a deep dive into financial data analysis and machine learning. It showcases a robust workflow for predicting stock prices using a Ridge Regression model.

**Key features include:**

-   **Interactive Data Acquisition**: Use intuitive widgets to select and fetch historical stock data for any company.
-   **Advanced Feature Engineering**: Create new features like moving averages to enhance the predictive power of the model.
-   **Comprehensive Visualization**: Visualize everything from raw data and moving averages to the final model predictions.
-   **Model Evaluation**: Assess the model's performance using standard metrics like Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

### Getting Started

You don't need to install anything on your local machine! Simply click the **"Open in Colab"** badge above to launch the notebook directly in your browser.

### Technologies Used

-   **Python**: The core programming language.
-   **pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
-   **yfinance**: For fetching historical stock data.
-   **matplotlib**: For creating visualizations.
-   **scikit-learn**: For building the Ridge Regression model.
-   **ipywidgets**: For the interactive user interface.
-   **Google Colab**: The platform used to create and run the notebook.

### Future Improvements

-   Explore other machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting).
-   Incorporate more features into the model, such as Open, High, Low, and Volume prices.
-   Add a feature for predicting a specific number of days into the future.
