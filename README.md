### Project Overview

This project is an interactive Google Colab notebook designed to introduce you to the fundamentals of financial data analysis and machine learning. Using Python, we will:

-   **Fetch** historical stock data from the web using the `yfinance` library.
-   **Analyze** and **visualize** stock price trends with `pandas` and `matplotlib`.
-   **Build** a simple Linear Regression model to predict future stock prices using `scikit-learn`.

This tool is perfect for beginners who want to explore Python libraries in a practical, real-world context.

### Getting Started

This project is best run in Google Colab. The "Open in Colab" badge above will take you directly to the notebook.
